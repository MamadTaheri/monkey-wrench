![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/MamadTaheri/monkey-wrench)

Hi. 
My name is Mohammad. Do you want to know what is the story of this repository?

### The Need

I am a frontend web developer from Iran. Sometimes I work on little tutorial projects and I need some test data and free APIs.

I always copy and paste them from the internet and my previous projects. It usually takes a long time. So, I decided to publish those data and APIs to my GitHub. you can use them for free.

Also, Feel free to fork this repo and add some Data and then send me PR.

Good luck.
